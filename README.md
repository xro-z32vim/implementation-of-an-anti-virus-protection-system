## üéØ Project Goals
The goal of this project is to design and implement an antivirus protection system with the following key components:

1. **Management Servers**: Centralized control of antivirus protection.
2. **Workstation Protection Module**: Secure all workstations in the domain.
3. **Server Protection Module**: Secure all servers in the domain.

All assets will be part of an **Active Directory (AD)** domain, ensuring a unified and manageable infrastructure.

## üìã System Requirements

### Hardware and Software Requirements:
- **Management Server**:
  - Operating System: Microsoft Windows Server.
  - Database Management: PostgreSQL for storing service information.
  - Active Directory domain integration.

- **Workstations and Servers**:
  - Antivirus software distributed centrally from the management server.

### Functional Requirements:
1. The management server must:
   - Scan specified network ranges and domains for new hosts.
   - Distribute antivirus software, modules, and databases centrally to assets based on their administrative group.
   - Update antivirus software and modules automatically on a schedule.
2. Workstations must:
   - Implement a policy to block selected categories of applications.
   - Send critical events to the management server.
3. Events from connected devices must:
   - Be logged in the event log of the management server.
   - Be sent to a SIEM system for monitoring information security events.
4. Remote technical support:
   - Technical specialists can view asset information and connect to a remote desktop without management rights.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### Deployment Steps:
1. **Pre-Project Survey**:
   - Conduct inventory and gather all necessary data about the infrastructure.
2. **Task Formulation**:
   - Define detailed requirements for the system to form the basis of the terms of reference.
3. **Design**:
   - Develop a technical solution describing the architecture and functioning of the system.
4. **Setup**:
   - Configure the management server, PostgreSQL database, and SIEM integration.
5. **Testing**:
   - Execute test programs to ensure the system meets functional requirements.
6. **Deployment**:
   - Roll out the solution across the infrastructure.
